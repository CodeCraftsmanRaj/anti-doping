        <h1>Module 2: Prohibited Substances</h1>
        <p>
            Prohibited substances are drugs, chemicals, or other agents that athletes are not allowed to use under the World Anti-Doping Code. These substances can provide an unfair competitive advantage and may harm the athlete's health.
        </p>
        <p>
            The list of prohibited substances is updated annually by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). It includes several categories, such as anabolic steroids, stimulants, narcotics, and masking agents. These substances are classified as prohibited in-competition, out-of-competition, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anabolic steroids, such as testosterone and its derivatives, are commonly abused substances that enhance muscle mass and strength. Stimulants like amphetamines increase alertness and reduce fatigue, while narcotics may be used to reduce pain, allowing athletes to perform longer or at higher intensities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of prohibited substances not only violates the rules of sport but also puts athletes at risk of serious health problems. For example, the use of anabolic steroids can lead to heart disease, liver damage, and psychological disorders. Stimulants can cause cardiovascular problems, while narcotics may lead to addiction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Athletes are responsible for ensuring that any medication they take does not contain prohibited substances. Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs) allow athletes to take certain medications for legitimate medical conditions, provided they do not give an unfair advantage.
