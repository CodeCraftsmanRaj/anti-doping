        <p>
            Anti-doping testing is a crucial part of maintaining fair play in sports. It ensures that athletes do not use prohibited substances or methods to gain an unfair advantage. The testing process involves the collection and analysis of biological samples, such as urine or blood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Athletes can be tested both in-competition and out-of-competition. In-competition testing occurs during or immediately after an event, while out-of-competition testing can happen at any time, even when athletes are not actively competing. This helps maintain a level playing field throughout the athlete’s career.
        </p>
        <p>
            Testing is usually carried out by doping control officers (DCOs) who follow strict protocols to ensure that the process is fair and unbiased. The samples collected are analyzed at accredited laboratories, and the results are reported to anti-doping organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            If an athlete tests positive for a prohibited substance, they may face sanctions, which can include disqualification from the event, suspension from competition, and even lifetime bans in severe cases. However, athletes have the right to appeal and request the testing of a B-sample to confirm the result.
        </p>
        <p>
            Compliance with anti-doping regulations is essential not only to maintain fair competition but also to protect athletes’ health. Anti-doping agencies continue to work on improving testing methods and ensuring that the rights of athletes are upheld throughout the process.
