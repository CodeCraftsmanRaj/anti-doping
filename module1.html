        <h1>Module 1: Introduction to Anti-Doping</h1>
        <p>
            Anti-doping refers to the set of rules, regulations, and programs designed to promote clean sport by preventing athletes from using prohibited substances or methods to enhance performance. It is not only essential to maintain the integrity of competition but also to protect athletes' health and well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anti-doping agencies, such as the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and national agencies like NADA, are responsible for the implementation of doping regulations. They work in collaboration with sports organizations to create a culture of fair play. These organizations set the rules and administer testing to ensure that athletes comply with anti-doping standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            The core elements of anti-doping include education, testing, and enforcement. Education programs are aimed at informing athletes, coaches, and medical staff about the dangers of doping. Testing involves collecting samples, usually urine or blood, to detect the presence of prohibited substances. Enforcement occurs when athletes are found to have violated anti-doping regulations, resulting in potential sanctions such as bans from competition.
        </p>
        <p>
            The World Anti-Doping Code is a fundamental document that harmonizes anti-doping policies globally. It establishes the rights and responsibilities of athletes and sports organizations. By following this code, all stakeholders ensure that anti-doping regulations are applied fairly and consistently across all sports and countries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anti-doping education plays a crucial role in the prevention of doping. Athletes need to be fully aware of the risks of doping, including the potential legal, health, and ethical consequences. Educational programs often emphasize the importance of competing with integrity, focusing on long-term athletic development rather than short-term performance enhancement through illicit means.
